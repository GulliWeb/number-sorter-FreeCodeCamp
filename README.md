# 🧮 Numeric Sorter

Welcome to the **Numeric Sorter** project! 🎉 This project is designed to help you understand and visualize fundamental sorting algorithms, including:

- 🔄 Bubble Sort
- 📋 Selection Sort
- 📝 Insertion Sort

By implementing these algorithms in JavaScript, you'll gain a solid understanding of how sorting works and how to apply these techniques in web applications.

## 📚 About the Project

This project provides a hands-on approach to learning sorting algorithms by allowing you to:
- Visualize the sorting process in real-time.
- Sort numerical data with different algorithms.
- Compare the efficiency of each sorting method.

## 🛠️ Built With
- JavaScript for implementing sorting algorithms.
- HTML/CSS for the project interface.

## 📈 Sorting Algorithms Explained
1. **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 🔄
2. **Selection Sort**: Finds the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element. 📋
3. **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by comparing the current element with the already sorted ones. 📝

## 🎨 Features
- Real-time sorting visualization.
- Adjustable sorting speed.
- Multiple algorithms to choose from.

## 🧩 How to Contribute
Feel free to contribute to this project by submitting pull requests. Any improvements or new sorting algorithms are welcome! 🤗
